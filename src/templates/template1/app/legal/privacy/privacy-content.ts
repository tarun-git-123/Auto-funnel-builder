<h3>Corporate address:</h3>

<p><strong>No personal information will be shared with any third parties without the customer's permission.</strong></p>

<p>This written statement (the "Privacy Policy") is created to inform you of our practices with regard to collecting, use, and disclosure/sharing of any information that you may supply through this Website and some related services. Please make sure you read this Privacy Policy completely before using our website or providing any personal information to this Website.</p>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>The Website's policy is to respect and safeguard our users' privacy. In order to comply with this policy, the Website promises to take the security measures outlined in this Privacy Policy to protect the privacy of the information you give us when using or accessing the Website.</p>

<h2>Your Content</h2>

<p>The Website's current policies and practices with regard to nonpublic personal information of Website users are outlined in this Privacy Policy. You accept the terms of this Privacy Policy by using this website. You authorize the collection, use, and disclosure of your information whenever you submit it through this Website in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Active Information Collection</h2>

<p>In the same way that many websites do, this Website actively collects information from its users by asking specific questions and by allowing you to get in touch with us directly via email and/or feedback forms. There's a chance that some of the data you provide will be personally identifiable (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and sales delivery, billing and credit card information). You might be required to provide information in some places of this Website in order for you to benefit from specific features (such newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to take part in a specific activity (such as other promotions). What information is necessary and what information is optional will be made clear to you at each point where information is collected.</p>

<h2>Disclosure Of Information</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, we may use your information to enhance the content of our Website, customize the Website to cater to your preferences, communicate with you (if you request it), conduct marketing and research, for the reasons specified in this Privacy Policy, and more. Unless we specifically state otherwise at the point of collection, we may merge personally identifiable information you submit to this website with other actively collected data.</p>

<p>Your personally identifiable information and data obtained passively may be combined. We may provide other affiliates around the world with your personally identifiable information provided they agree to handle it in line with our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Additionally, we may share your personal information with third parties in the United States and/or other countries, but only to those contractors we use to support our business(e.g., fulfillment services, technical support, delivery services, and financial institutions). In this case, we will ask these third parties to agree to treat you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of this website to which information relates, in which case such purchaser must agree to treat the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy; or as required by applicable laws, court orders, or governmental regulations.</p>

<p>We also make the most of information collected through this website in a non-personally identifiable format.</p>

<h2>Security Of Information</h2>

<p>You may rest easy knowing that any personal information gathered by the Website is kept safe and is consistent and up to date with industry standards. We are extremely concerned about the security of all personal information pertaining to our customers. Your private information is safeguarded in a number of ways.</p>

<p>Your private information is kept on a secure server with password-protected access restricted to only a few contractors and staff of ${config.company.name}. Credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by reputable third-party banking, processing agents, and distribution institutions in order to best serve you.</p>

<p>They receive the data required to process and ship your order, as well as to validate and authorize your credit card or other payment information. Unfortunately, no wireless network or the internet can ever completely ensure the 100 % security of any data transmission.</p>

<h2>Passive Information Collection</h2>

<p>Using a variety of technologies and methods, including Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collecting, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively submitting the information) while you navigate through a website. The Internet Protocol (IP) addresses may be used on this Website.</p>

<p>Because an IP address is typically dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer), it is generally regarded as non-personally identifiable information. An IP address is a number that your Internet service provider assigns to your computer so you can access the Internet. Your IP address is used by us to administer and enhance customer services, report aggregate data, identify the quickest connection path for your computer to use while connecting to our Website, and identify issues with our server.</p>

<p>A website can remember information about you and your preferences by using a small piece of data called a "cookie" that the website sends to your web browser. "Session cookies" are temporary pieces of data that vanish after you close your web browser window or otherwise turn off your computer. Session cookies are used to enhance website browsing and collect aggregate statistical data. Session cookies are used on this website. "Persistent cookies" are more permanent pieces of data that are stored on your computer's hard disk and remain there unless you delete them.</p>

<p>Persistent cookies keep track of information on your computer for a variety of uses, including retrieving previously provided information (such as your username), assisting in determining which parts of the website visitors value the most, and customizing the website based on your preferences. Persistent cookies are used on this Website. Internet tags, often referred to as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs, are smaller than cookies and provide the website server with information about the visitor's computer, including the IP address and browser type.</p>

<p>Internet tags are used on this website. "Navigational data" (also known as "log files," "server logs," and "clickstream" data) and "Internet Tags" are used for system management/ administration, website content improvement, market research, and information communication to visitors. This Website uses navigational data.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>To aid in preventing unauthorized access and maintaining data security, we have implemented specific physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. Secure 256-bit SSL Encryption is used to process payments. Credit card information and other personal information will not be traded, sold, or shared with any third-party service providers.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This privacy statement might change over time. Whenever we make any significant changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll send you a notification through email to the email address connected to your account. You can notify us by letter or by email if you do not agree with the modified version (for instance, if you object to how we now plan to use your personal information). If you don't object in writing, we'll assume that you're okay with the Privacy Policy's modifications. Except as may be required by law, changes won't apply retroactively to personal data that was collected before the modifications to the Privacy Policy.</p>
